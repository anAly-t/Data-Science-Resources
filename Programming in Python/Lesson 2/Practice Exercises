Lesson 2 Practice Exercises
Data Types, Variables, Data Structures, & Operators
Exercise 1: Data Type Identification

Write a Python script that defines the following variables and prints their data types using the type() function:

An integer variable x = 10
A floating-point variable y = 20.5
A string variable name = "Alice"
A list variable my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
A boolean variable is_valid = True

# SOLUTION:
x = 10
y = 20.5
name = "Alice"
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
is_valid = True

# Print the data types
print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(name))
print(type(my_list))
print(type(is_valid))
    
Exercise 2: Variable Swapping

Given two variables a = 5 and b = 10, swap their values without using a temporary variable. Print their values before and after the swap.


# SOLUTION
a = 5
b = 10

# Print values before swap
print("Before swap: a =", a, "b =", b)

# Swap without temporary variable
a, b = b, a

# Print values after swap
print("After swap: a =", a, "b =", b)
    
Exercise 3: List Operations

Create a list numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25] and perform the following operations:

Append the number 30 to the list.
Remove the number 15 from the list.
Sort the list in descending order.
Print the final list.

# SOLUTION
numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]

# Append 30
numbers.append(30)

# Remove 15
numbers.remove(15)

# Sort in descending order
numbers.sort(reverse=True)

# Print final list
print(numbers)
    
Exercise 4: Dictionary Manipulation

Given a dictionary student = {"name": "John", "age": 20, "grade": "A"}, perform the following operations:

Update the student's age to 21.
Add a new key-value pair for the student's major: "major": "Computer Science".
Remove the key "grade" from the dictionary.
Print the final dictionary.

# SOLUTION
student = {"name": "John", "age": 20, "grade": "A"}

# Update age
student["age"] = 21

# Add major
student["major"] = "Computer Science"

# Remove grade
student.pop("grade")

# Print final dictionary
print(student)
    
Exercise 5: Arithmetic and Comparison Operators

Write a Python program that does the following:

Take two inputs num1 and num2 from the user.
Print the sum, difference, product, and division of the two numbers.
Compare the two numbers and print whether num1 is greater than, less than, or equal to num2.

# SOLUTION
num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Arithmetic operations
print("Sum:", num1 + num2)
print("Difference:", num1 - num2)
print("Product:", num1 * num2)
print("Division:", num1 / num2)

# Comparison
if num1 > num2:
    print(num1, "is greater than", num2)
elif num1 < num2:
    print(num1, "is less than", num2)
else:
    print(num1, "is equal to", num2)
    
Exercise 6: Tuple Unpacking

Given the tuple person = ("Alice", 30, "Engineer"), unpack its elements into three variables name, age, and profession. Print each variable.


# SOLUTION
person = ("Alice", 30, "Engineer")

# Unpack tuple
name, age, profession = person

# Print values
print("Name:", name)
print("Age:", age)
print("Profession:", profession)
