1. What is the main difference between a list and a tuple?
Answer: B) Lists are mutable, while tuples are immutable.
Explanation: Lists can be modified after their creation, meaning you can add, remove, or change elements. Tuples, however, cannot be modified; once created, their contents remain fixed. This immutability makes tuples suitable for use as keys in dictionaries or for ensuring that data remains constant throughout the program.

2. Which method can be used to add an item to a list?
Answer: D) Both A and C (append() and insert()).
Explanation: The append() method adds an item to the end of a list, while the insert() method allows you to add an item at a specified index. Thus, both methods are valid for adding items to a list.

3. What will be the output of the following code?
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4}; print(3 in my_set)
Answer: A) True
Explanation: The in keyword checks for membership within a set. Since the number 3 is indeed present in my_set, the output will be True.

4. How do you access the value associated with the key 'name' in the following dictionary?
my_dict = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25}
Answer: D) Both A and C (my_dict['name'] and my_dict.get('name')).
Explanation: You can access dictionary values using square bracket notation with the key (e.g., my_dict['name']) or by using the get() method (e.g., my_dict.get('name')). Both methods yield the same result, which is the value associated with the key 'name'.

5. Which of the following is a valid way to create an empty set?
Answer: C) empty_set = set()
Explanation: The correct way to create an empty set in Python is by using the set() constructor. Using {} creates an empty dictionary, not a set. Therefore, empty_set = set() is the only valid option.

6. What happens when you try to add a duplicate element to a set?
Answer: C) It ignores the duplicate.
Explanation: Sets in Python do not allow duplicate elements. If you try to add an element that is already in the set, it will simply be ignored, and the set will remain unchanged.

7. Which of the following statements about tuples is true?
Answer: B) Tuples can contain duplicate elements.
Explanation: Tuples, like lists, can contain duplicate values. However, they are immutable, which means that once they are created, their contents cannot be altered. Other statements in the options are false; tuples can hold mixed data types and can be used as dictionary keys.

8. How can you remove a key-value pair from a dictionary?
Answer: C) del my_dict['key']
Explanation: The del statement is used to remove a key-value pair from a dictionary. The method my_dict.remove('key') does not exist, making option C the only correct choice.

9. What will the output of the following code be?
my_list = [1, 2, 3]; print(my_list * 2)
Answer: A) [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
Explanation: The * operator can be used with lists to repeat the list a specified number of times. In this case, multiplying my_list by 2 results in the list being duplicated.

10. What is the output of this code?
my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}; my_dict['a'] = my_dict['a'] + 2; print(my_dict['a'])
Answer: C) 3
Explanation: This code retrieves the value associated with the key 'a', adds 2 to it, and then assigns the new value back to the key 'a'. Initially, 'a' has a value of 1, so after the addition, it becomes 3, which is then printed.
